            scope of var, let, and const.</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold"><span class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">Answer: </span>
            In JavaScript, var, let, and const are used to declare variables, but they have different scopes and
            behaviors. Understanding the scope of these declarations is crucial for writing clean and bug-free code.
            <br>
            <br> Var: <br>
            <br>
            var declarations are function-scoped. This means that a variable declared with var is accessible within the
            function in which it is declared or in the global scope if declared outside of any function.
            Variables declared with var are hoisted to the top of their containing function or the global scope. This
            means that they are moved to the top of the function during the compilation phase, so you can use them
            before they are actually declared in your code.
            <br>
            <br> Let: <br>
            <br>
            Let declarations are block-scoped. This means that a variable declared with let is only accessible within
            the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which it is declared.
            Variables declared with let are not hoisted to the top of their containing block, and they have a temporal
            dead zone (TDZ) where trying to access them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
            <br>
            <br> Const: <br>
            <br>
            Const declarations are also block-scoped like let.
            Variables declared with const must be assigned a value when declared, and their values cannot be reassigned
            after declaration. However, the value of a const object (e.g., an array or object) can still be modified;
            it's the reference that remains constant.

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium"><span class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Question-2: </span>Tell us the
            use cases of null and undefined.</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold"><span class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">Answer: </span> In JavaScript,
            null and undefined are two distinct primitive values, and they are often used in different contexts and have
            different use cases.
            <br>
            <br>
            Use cases for null:
            <br>
            <br>
        <ol class="list-disc text-2xl font-semibold">
            <li>To initialize a variable that will later hold an object or a value.</li>
            <li>To clear or reset the value of a variable or property when it's no longer needed.</li>
            <li>In some cases, it may be used to check if a variable or object property has been intentionally set to an
                empty or non-existent value.</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold">Use cases for undefined:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <ol class="list-disc text-2xl font-semibold">
            <li>As the initial value of variables that have not been assigned any value.</li>
            <li>As the default return value of functions that don't explicitly return anything.</li>
            <li>To check if a property exists in an object (though this can sometimes lead to subtle bugs since
                undefined is a valid property value).</li>
        </ol>
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-3xl font-medium"><span class="text-3xl font-bold text-red-600">Question-3: </span>What do you
            mean by REST API?</h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-2xl font-semibold"><span class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-600">Answer: </span> A REST API is a
            way for computer programs to talk to each other over the internet. It follows some rules to make this
            communication clear and organized.
            <br>
            <br>
            No Memory: Each conversation is like a fresh start; the computer doesn't remember past talks.
            <br>
            <br>
            Two Roles: There are two sides: one that gives information (server) and one that asks for it (client).
            <br>
            <br>
            Resources: Information is organized into things called resources, and each resource has a unique address.
            <br>
            <br>
            Actions: You can do things with resources like getting data (GET), adding new data (POST), changing data
            (PUT), or deleting it (DELETE).
            <br>
            <br>
            Always the Same: The way you talk to the computer is always the same, which makes it easy for both sides to
            understand each other.
            <br>
            <br>
            Different Languages: You can use different ways to talk to the computer, like using numbers or words.
            <br>
            <br>
            No Secrets: Conversations are open, and nothing is hidden, making it easy to share information.
            <br>
            <br>
            Clear Conversations: The messages between computers are simple and clear so that everyone can understand.
            <br>
            <br>
            In a nutshell, REST APIs help computers talk to each other in a structured and straightforward way, making
            it easier to share and access information on the internet.
